      <title>A Quantitative Pipeline for the Idenficiation of Combinations of Targets for Claudin-Low Triple Negative Breast Cancer Reversion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Claudin-Low Triple Negative Breast Cancer (CL TNBC) has high relapse and low survival rates. Due to the tumors’ decreased response to cytotoxic drugs and hormone therapy, alternative therapeutic strategies should be explored. One such strategy is tumor reversion, the biological process by which tumor cells lose a significant fraction of their malignant phenotype. Tumor reversion has been observed for over a century and has been achieved &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt;. In particular, tumor reversion has been achieved &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; with the CL cell line MDA-MB-231, and &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; in mice xenografted with MDA-MB-231 cells. This project takes a dynamical systems approach to identify &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; combinations of therapeutic targets for CL TNBC reversion. An intracellular signaling network was reconstructed with multi-omics profile data for MDA-MB-231. Then a structure-based attractor-based control method for nonlinear dynamic systems was applied to the network to identify driver nodes of the system. Topological signal flow analysis was applied to the network for virtual screenings of driver node perturbations to predict their effect on the system. Combinations of nodes whose concerted perturbation resulted in the system shifting from the tumorigenic basin of attraction to the normal-like basin of attraction were deemed putative concerted reversion targets. Through this methodology, several potential combinations of targets that may shift the cell from a tumorigenic to a normal-like phenotype have been identified to be further validated in future work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The development of an open and general maternal-fetal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for drugs metabolized by cytochromes P450 isoenzymes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Pregnancy causes extensive physiological changes impacting drug exposure in mother and fetus. Predicting a drug’s pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is crucial to ensuring safe and efficacious dosing during pregnancy. Conducting clinical PK trials in pregnancy, however, is both logistically and ethically challenging. Physiologically-based (PB) PK models can provide in silico predictions of drug exposures during pregnancy by accounting for known physiologic changes. These models can guide dosing prior to drug administration and refine dosing once initial exposures are determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal-fetal and non-pregnant PBPK models were developed (R, mrgsolve) to predict maternal/fetal exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by liver CYP450 enzymes (3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2B6). Model parameters, initially based on literature, were refined using sensitivity analyses followed by parameter optimization. Models were validated by comparing observed and predicted PK profiles of 10 drugs: midazolam, metoprolol, caffeine, nifedipine, nevirapine, artemether, indinavir, buprenorphine, codeine and methadone.
Results: The relative error (RE) in predicted estimates of area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) across all tested drugs were 0.17 - 33.1% for AUC and 1.57 - 50.7% for Cmax in the non-pregnant model and 3.34 - 38.1% (AUC) and 7.88 - 23.8% (Cmax) in the pregnant model. Sensitivity analyses and parameter optimization further improved model predictions of these PK parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; The described PBPK model provides a reproducible, open-source system for model-informed decision for exploring and developing exposure-based dosing recommendations in maternal/fetal patient populations. Inclusion of individual genotype data may further improve the modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

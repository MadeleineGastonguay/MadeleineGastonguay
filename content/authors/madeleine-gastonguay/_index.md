I am a recent graduate of the University of Connecticut Honors program with a degree in Applied Mathematics. During my time at the University of Connecticut, I completed my undergraduate thesis at the UConn Health Center’s Center for Quantitative Medicine with the Computational Systems Medicine Team. Currently, I’m working in the Churchill Lab at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine while I decide what I would like to study in grad school. In my down time I love all outdoor adventures in Acadia National Park and singing for my cats :smiley_cat:.

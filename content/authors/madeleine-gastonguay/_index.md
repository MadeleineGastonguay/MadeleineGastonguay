I am a graduate of the University of Connecticut Honors program with a degree in Applied Mathematics and minor in Bioinformatics. I completed my undergraduate thesis at the UConn Health Center’s Center for Quantitative Medicine with the Computational Systems Medicine Team. Currently, I’m working in the Churchill Lab at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine while I apply to PhD programs. As a certified instructor with The Carpentries, I am involved in bioinformatics and data science training and an advocate of open source science. I am passionate about contributing to the development and improvement of individualized treatment options through the use of mathematical and statistical models. In my down time I love all outdoor adventures in Acadia National Park and singing for my cats :smiley_cat:.

I am a PhD candidate in biomedical engineering at the Johns Hopkins University Institute for Computational Medicine. I am currently working with Dr. Alison Hill and Dr. Feilim Mac Gabhann to build mathematical models and statistical inference frameworks for within-host viral dynamics, integrated with quantitative systems pharmacology models of novel immunotherapies. I received a Bachelor of Science in applied mathematics from the University of Connecticut, where I worked with Dr. Paola Vera-Licona at the Center for Quantitative Medicine to identify putative tumor reversion targets using dynamical systems methods. Following graduation, I spent two years as a post-baccalaureate researcher developing Bayesian methods for systems genetics applications with Dr. Gary Churchill at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine. I am fascinated by the use of mathematical and statistical modeling to understand biology, and I foresee a career developing models to aid in the development of novel therapeutic modalities.

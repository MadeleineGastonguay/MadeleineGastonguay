I am a graduate of the University of Connecticut Honors program with a degree in Applied Mathematics and minor in Bioinformatics. I completed my undergraduate thesis at the UConn Health Center for Quantitative Medicine with the Computational Systems Medicine Team. I worked as a post-bacc researcher in the Churchill Lab at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine until 2022, when I joined the Biomedical Engineering PhD program at Johns Hopkins University. I am currently a PhD candidate working with Dr. Alison Hill to develop mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics and statistical methods for parameter estimation. I am fascinated by the use of mathematical and statistical modeling to understand biology, and I foresee a career pursing this research to contribute to the discovery and development of individualized therapeutics.

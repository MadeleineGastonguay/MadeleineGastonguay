summary: In collaboration with the Valdar lab at UNC, we developed a Bayesian model selection approach to mediation analysis implemented in the bmediatR R package. This approach allows for flexibility in both data inputs and potential inferences and uses conjugate priors to increase efficiency. I am currently extending the framework to allow for the inference of moderated mediation.

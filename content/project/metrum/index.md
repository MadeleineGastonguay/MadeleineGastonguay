summary: During a summer internship at Metrum Research Group, I worked with a team of interns to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for maternal and fetal drug disposition throughout pregnancy. By integrating published data from studies in non-pregnant women with prior knowledge of anatomical, physiological, and biochemical changes associated with pregnancy, we were able to predict drug exposures in a population with limited experimental data. The resulting model can guide dosing prior to drug administration and refine dosing once initial exposures are determined.

Pregnancy causes extensive physiological changes impacting drug exposure in mother and fetus. Predicting a drugâ€™s pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is crucial to ensuring safe and efficacious dosing during pregnancy. Conducting clinical PK trials in pregnancy, however, is both logistically and ethically challenging. Physiologically-based (PB) PK models can provide *in silico* predictions of drug exposures during pregnancy by accounting for known physiologic changes. These models can guide dosing prior to drug administration and refine dosing once initial exposures are determined.

We developed maternal-fetal and non-pregnant PBPK models implemented as a system of ordinary differential equations in R with mrgsolve to predict maternal/fetal exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by liver CYP450 enzymes (3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2B6). Model parameters, initially based on literature, were refined using local sensitivity analyses followed by parameter optimization. Models were validated by comparing observed and predicted PK profiles of 10 drugs: midazolam, metoprolol, caffeine, nifedipine, nevirapine, artemether, indinavir, buprenorphine, codeine and methadone. 

The relative error (RE) in predicted estimates of area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) across all tested drugs were 0.17 - 33.1\% for AUC and 1.57 - 50.7\% for Cmax in the non-pregnant model and 3.34 - 38.1\% (AUC) and 7.88 - 23.8\% (Cmax) in the pregnant model. Sensitivity analyses and parameter optimization further improved model predictions of these PK parameters. The described PBPK model provides a reproducible, open-source system for model-informed decision for exploring and developing exposure-based dosing recommendations in maternal/fetal patient populations. Inclusion of individual genotype data may further improve predictions by accounting for the difference in clearance between poor and extensive metabolizers.

abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic population model of midazolam in critically ill children with primary respiratory failure. DESIGN: Prospective pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic observational study. SETTING: Thirteen PICUs across the United States. PATIENTS: Pediatric subjects mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure, weight greater than or equal to 7 kg, receiving morphine and/or midazolam continuous infusions. INTERVENTIONS: Serial blood sampling for drug quantification and a single blood collection for genomic evaluation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concentrations of midazolam, the 1' (1`-hydroxymidazolam metabolite) and 4' (4`-hydroxymidazolam metabolite) hydroxyl, and the 1' and 4' glucuronide metabolites were measured. Subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism chip. Nonlinear mixed effects modeling was performed to develop the pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic model. Body weight, age, hepatic and renal functions, and the UGT2B7 rs62298861 polymorphism are relevant predictors of midazolam pharmacokinetic variables. The estimated midazolam clearance was 0.61 L/min/70kg. Time to reach 50% complete mature midazolam and 1`-hydroxymidazolam metabolite/4`-hydroxymidazolam metabolite clearances was 1.0 and 0.97 years postmenstrual age. The final model suggested a decrease in midazolam clearance with increase in alanine transaminase and a lower clearance of the glucuronide metabolites with a renal dysfunction. In the pharmacogenomic analysis, rs62298861 and rs28365062 in the UGT2B7 gene were in high linkage disequilibrium. Minor alleles were associated with a higher 1`-hydroxymidazolam metabolite clearance in Caucasians. In the pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic model, clearance was expected to increase by 10% in heterozygous and 20% in homozygous for the minor allele with respect to homozygous for the major allele. CONCLUSIONS: This work leveraged available knowledge on nonheritable and heritable factors affecting midazolam pharmacokinetic in pediatric subjects with primary respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, providing the basis for a future implementation of an individual-based approach to sedation."
